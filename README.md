# MA705-Craft-Beer-Dashboard
## Dashboard Description:
The following dashboard is meant to help beer lovers find the perfect craft beer. The dashboard will show nearly 38,000 craft beers from around the globe along with their review score, aroma, appearance, palate and taste scores, their ABV, brewery and style. Users of the dashboard will be able to find craft beers that may interest them by filtering through a dropdown of styles and through a ABV range slider. The results of their filtering will be reflected in a table showing all of the resulting beers and their features as well as a bar graph showing each beer and its overall rating out of 5 along with its style (indicated by the color of the bar)
## Data Sources:
The data set used for this project came from: https://data.world/socialmediadata/beeradvocate.
Any missing values were replaced with N/A values and duplicates of each beer were removed leaving the highest score remaining.
